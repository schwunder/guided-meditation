- **Refactor checkpoint flow** — keep orchestration in one timeline controller and delete bespoke helpers; push sizing and layout concerns to CSS variables/animations; log candidates for deletion when they no longer serve the current sequence.
- **Repo essentials** — `public/index.html` is the single entry point where CSS variables define timing (`--transition-duration-fade`, `--checkpoint-hold-ms`) and styling (`--accent-hue-*`); `public/main.js` is the lone script owning asset caching, stage creation, and the linear `MEDITATION_SEQUENCE`; `server.js` is a Bun dev server that hand-maps `/`, `/main.js`, and `/assets/*` to `public/`.
- **Asset metadata** — `checkpoint-metadata.json` lists every checkpoint/choice asset with `title` and `description` fields, yet nothing loads it; asset folders under `public/assets/` split into `checkpoints/`, `transitions/`, `chakras/`, and `archive/` footage.
- **Current technical model** — the **asset loader** (`ensureMediaEntry`) owns preload and caching while surfacing load errors promptly; the **stage manager** (`buildStage`, `activateStage`, `scheduleStageRemoval`) swaps DOM layers and mirrors CSS timing with a fallback timeout; the **sequence controller** (`runSequence`, `waitForStage`) reads `MEDITATION_SEQUENCE`, respecting CSS-derived holds and video playback before advancing.
- **Open follow-ups** — wire `checkpoint-metadata.json` into the stage builder for alt text and richer captions; relax Bun routing so any new JSON/audio in `public/` serves without extra branches; define how branching or interactive choices should pause or fork the sequence beyond the linear run; document how new media variants (ambient audio, layered transitions) plug into the asset loader without breaking cache reuse.
