## Implemented Features
| Area | Highlights |
| --- | --- |
| Sequence Flow | `MEDITATION_SEQUENCE` drives the fixed five-step run (checkpoint → transition → checkpoint → transition → checkpoint); `runSequence` iterates it via `presentSequenceItem` so both entry types share orchestration; checkpoints honor the CSS dwell from `--checkpoint-hold-ms`, while transition videos block until playback ends. |
| Stage Presentation | `buildStage` wraps every asset in `<figure class="media-wrapper">` and generates `<figcaption>` content and optional choice lists; `activateStage` flips `is-active` to trigger CSS fades and queues cleanup through `scheduleStageRemoval`; `ensureMediaEntry` caches `<img>` and `<video>` elements per asset for instant reuse. |
| Styling Contract | CSS variables (`--transition-duration-fade`, `--checkpoint-hold-ms`, `--accent-hue-*`) in `public/index.html` define the timing/visual contract consumed by JavaScript; `.media-wrapper` flex column layout keeps captions under media while animated borders stay synced to the accent hue; `.caption-container` styles checkpoints and transitions alike, rendering choice lists as a compact grid. |
| Dynamic Hue Accent | `createHueController` tracks checkpoint count and flips `--accent-hue` after the second checkpoint to shift the animated border; `numericCssVariable` reads hue tokens so designers can retune the palette without code. |
| Asset Library | Media lives under `public/assets/` with subfolders for checkpoints, transitions, chakras, and archived experiments; `ensureMediaEntry` URL-encodes asset paths and preloads them during initialization to surface errors early. |
